# Air-Quality-Prediction
Air Quality Analysis
This project aims to analyze air quality data and predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using different machine learning algorithms.




**Dependencies**<br>
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn




**Data**<br>
The project uses a dataset stored in a CSV file named 'data.csv'. The dataset contains information about air quality measurements, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), respiratory suspended particulate matter (RSPM), and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in different locations. The dataset also includes other attributes like state, location type, and pollution agency.
